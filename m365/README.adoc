= GearConnect: Multi-Tenant App for ScubaGear
:toc:
:experimental:
:title-page:

This directory includes code for automating ScubaGear execution in an Azure environment against one or more tenants.
Note that this document assumes knowledge of https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear/tree/main[ScubaGear].

== Overview
GearConnect consists of infrastructure deployed in a host tenant for running ScubaGear and an installation script used by tenants to install the ScubaConnect application.
GearConnect is configured to automatically run ScubaGear against tenants on configurable schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly.)
ScubaGear configuration files and results files are read from and written to Azure storage.

GearConnect can be used to run ScubaGear against the tenant it is deployed in or it can be used in a multi-tenant setting to run ScubaGear against multiple other tenants.

NOTE: GCC High environments are separated from commercial and GCC. Deploy GearConnect in the same environment as the tenants you intend to run on. (Commercial and GCC can communicate between each other.)

== Installation

GearConnect requires two primary steps to install and use.

. Deploying resources to host tenant with terraform. See <<deploy>>
. Onboarding tenants via uploading configuration files and running install script. See <<onboard>>

=== Requirements

Before deploying GearConnect, the following will need to be installed on your machine:

* https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform[Terraform] - Used for deploying and managing infrastructure
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli[Azure CLI] - Used for authenticating and interacting with your Azure environment
** Be sure to also follow the instructions to sign in

[#deploy]
=== Deploying with Terraform

. Run `az login` if not already done to configure your credentials
. Prepare a directory for your deployment
.. Change directories to `m365/terraform/env`
.. Create a copy of the `example` directory with a name of your choice (e.g., `<myenv>`). **The remaining steps should be completed in this new directory.**
. Update variables and configurations
.. In your new directory, `<myenv>`, modify the `variables.tfvars` file to configure the deployment for your needs. 
... Set `contact_emails` to administrators' emails and set `resource_group_name` to the resource group to create and deploy infrastructure in
... Review the defaults used for optional variables in <<terraform-variables>>. Some of these may need to be modified depending on your environment
.. In `provider.tf`, replace `<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>` with the Subscription ID you'll be deploying in. The subscription ID can be found in the console, or as the `id` field output by the command `az account show`
.. (Optional, but recommended) Modify the `provider.tf` file to configure Terraform to store state in Azure. See external https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/azurerm[documentation].
. Run terraform
.. In your `<myenv>` directory, Run `terraform init`. This only needs to be done once unless providers are updated
.. In your `<myenv>` directory, Run `terraform apply -var-file=variables.tfvars`. Confirm changes meet your expectations then type "yes"
. Onboard a tenant following the guidance in <<onboard>>

[#terraform-variables]
==== Terraform Variables
This section provides the description for all terraform variables sorted by their likelihood of being changed.
For a typical deployment, set `contact_emails` and `resource_group_name` then review the defaults for the optional variables and override in the `tfvars` file as needed.


Required::
`contact_emails` (string) ::: Emails to notify for alerts and before certificate expiry
`resource_group_name` (string) ::: Resource group to create and build resources in
Optional::
`location` (string) [default=East US]::: Region to build resources in
`schedule_interval` (string) [default=Week]::: The interval to run the scheduled job on.
`app_name` (string) [default=ScubaConnect]::: App name. Displayed in Azure console on installed tenants
`app_multi_tenant` (bool) [default=False]::: If true, the app will be able to be installed in multiple tenants. By default, it is only available in this tenant
`vnet` (object) [default=None]::: Configuration for the vnet, including the address space, ACI subnet, and a list of allowed IP ranges. All strings in CIDR format
`firewall` (object) [default=None]::: Configuration for an Azure Firewall; if not null, traffic will be routed through this firewall
`serial_number` (string) [default=01]::: Increment by 1 when re-provisioning with the same resource group name
`image_path` (string) [default=./cisa_logo.png]::: Path to image used for app logo. Displayed in Azure console on installed tenants
Advanced::
`certificate_rotation_period_days` (number) [default=30]::: How many days between when the certificate key should be rotated. Note: rotation requires running terraform
`create_app` (bool) [default=True]::: If true, the app will be created. If false, the app will be imported
`prefix_override` (string) [default=None]::: Prefix for resource names. If null, one will be generated from app_name
`input_storage_container_url` (string) [default=None]::: If not null, input container to read configs from (must give permissions to service account). Otherwise by default will create storage container.
`output_storage_container_url` (string) [default=None]::: If not null, output container to put results in (must give permissions to service account). Otherwise by default will create storage container.
`tenants_dir_path` (string) [default=./tenants]::: Relative path to directory containing tenant configuration files in yaml
`container_registry` (object) [default={'server': 'ghcr.io'}]::: Credentials for logging into registry with container image
`container_image` (string) [default=ghcr.io/cisagov/scubaconnect-m365:latest]::: Docker image to use for running ScubaGear.

[#onboard]
=== Onboarding a Tenant

To onboard a tenant, open powershell and run `./Install-GearConnect.ps1 -AppId <app_id>` where `app_id` is output by Terraform.
This script must be run even in a single-tenant architecture to actually install the app.

Once completed, upload a ScubaGear configuration file to the `input_storage_container_url` named `<tenant_fqdn>.yaml` (e.g., `myorg.onmicrosoft.com.yaml`).
You may upload the file directly to Azure, or place it in `env/<your_env>/tenants/` and run `terraform apply`.
Refer to the https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear/blob/main/docs/configuration/configuration.md#scuba-compliance-use[ScubaGear Configuration File documentation] for details on creating the configuration file.

Repeat these steps for each tenant in a multi-tenant architecture.

=== Logging / Alerts

Terraform will create a Log Analytics Workspace (`scubaconnect-monitor-loganalytics`) which will hold logs from the container.
There will be two pre-created searches available: `scubaconnect Container Logs (7d)` and `scubaconnect Last Run Output`.
These allow you to quickly view output from the container. 

The container will exit with a non-zero code if it fails to run ScubaGear on any tenant.
A log-based alert is pre-configured to send an email to `contact_emails` when this occurs.
Looks into the "Last Run Output" logs to determine the cause.


=== Maintenance

GearConnect utilizes a certificate to authenticate to tenants.
This certificate is configured to expire after 1 year.
60 days prior to expiration, an email will be sent.
Running `terraform apply` will update the certificate for you.

The container will be regularly rebuilt and updated overtime to support new versions of ScubaGear.
No action is required for container updates as Azure Container Instances will grab the latest image by default.

== Additional Code Information

`scheduled` vs `adhoc` container instances::
GearConnect creates two nearly identical container instances named `scheduled` and `adhoc`.
When either container is run, they output their respective name to a field in the `ScubaResults` file: `MetaData/RunType`.
The runbook triggers the `scheduled` container instances and the `adhoc` container instance is intended for manual runs.
Azure does not allow changing input variables to a container instance, so this is why both are created.
